<dt style="font-style:italic;color:green;font-weight:bold;font-size:30px">Aeronautics</dt>
<dd style="font-style:italic;color:gold;font-weight:normal;font-size:25px">NASA is with you when you fly. Every U.S. aircraft and air traffic control tower has NASA-developed technology on board. The agency is helping transform aviation further by dramatically reducing its environmental impact, maintaining safety in more crowded skies, and paving the way to revolutionary aircraft shapes and propulsion.

<dt style="font-style:italic;color:maroon;font-weight:bold;font-size:30px">Science</dt>
<dd style="font-style:italic;color:gold;font-weight:normal;font-size:25px">NASA is conducting an unprecedented array of missions that will seek new knowledge and understanding of Earth, the solar system and the universe.

We're studying Earth right now through current and future spacecraft helping answer critical challenges facing our planet: climate change, sea level rise, freshwater resources and extreme weather events. As an innovation leader in Earth and climate science, NASA is constantly expanding view of our planet from space, with an exceptional team of experts, and decades of innovative scientific and technical research.</dd>
